# Conflation

## Overview

- conflation of semantic attributes from [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) to lanelet map based on results of [matching](matching.md)
- visualization of agreement between amount of lanes in [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) and adjacent lanes in lanelet map
- removal of lanelet fragments if they are likely to be mapped wrongly

### 1. Attribute transfer

- allowed participant and speed limit in lanelet2 inferred from lanelet attributes `subtype` and `location`
- relevant combinations shown in table below (taken from [lanelet2](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/blob/master/lanelet2_core/doc/LaneletAndAreaTagging.md))

|   `subtype`    | `location` |              Description               |    Inferred participants     |       Speed limit       |
| :------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------: |
|     `road`     |  `urban`   |    A part of a road in urban region    |    All vehicles and bikes    |    City speed limit     |
|     `road`     | `nonurban` |  A part of a road in nonurban region   |    All vehicles and bikes    |  Nonurban speed limit   |
|   `highway`    |  `urban`   |  A part of a highway in urban region   |         All vehicles         |   Urban highway limit   |

- highway tag from [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) used to infer attributes `subtype` and `location` according to following custom mapping:

|       `service`       | For access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park, alleys, etc. Can be used in conjunction with `service=*` to indicate the type of usage and with `access=*` to indicate who can use it and in what circumstances.                                                                    |     `road`     |  `urban`   |
| `road` (unknown type) | A road/way/street/motorway/etc. of unknown type. It can stand for anything ranging from a footpath to a motorway. This tag should only be used temporarily until the road/way/etc. has been properly surveyed. If you do know the road type, do not use this value, instead use one of the more specific `highway=*` values. |                |            |
|       `busway`        | A dedicated roadway for bus rapid transit systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   `bus_lane`   |  `urban`   |
|      `cycleway`       | For designated cycleways. Add `foot=*`, though it may be avoided if default-access-restrictions do apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `bicycle_lane` |            |

- additionally, the following attributes are transferred to their counterparts:
  - transfer of `maxspeed` tag to lanelet2 `speed_limit` tag
  - transfer of `name` tag to lanelet2 `road_name` tag
  - transfer of `surface` tag to lanelet2 `road_surface` tag
  - transfer of `oneway` tag to lanelet2 `one_way` tag
  - transfer of `lane_markings` tag to lanelet2 `lane_markings` tag
- attribute transfer realized based on stored lanelets in the collapsed centerlines from the preprocessing step
- if the value of an attribute in [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) changes over a match, the corresponding lanelets are splitted
- images below show principle of simple attribute transfer and the special case of an attribute change during a match

  ![image](img/transfer_split_ll_pre.png){height=150px} ![image](img/transfer_split_ll_post.png){height=150px}

### 2. Evaluation of Adjacent Lanes

- sum up the amount of adjacent lanelets in the lanelet map
- compare to `lanes` attribute from [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) (also considering the attribute `shoulder` and incrementing the amount of lanes, if necessary) and colorize lanelets correspondingly
- image below shows the process for the evaluation\
  ![image](img/evaluation_adjacent_lanes.png)

  - `lanes` tag = amount of adjacent lanelets => green
  - `lanes` tag != amount of adjacent lanelets => red
  - no `lanes` tag => blue
  - no match for polyline => white

- if `lanes` or `shoulder` change over a match, the process is analogous to the attribute transfer (splitting of lanelets)

### 3. Deletion of Lanelet Fragments

- if for an identified match the lanelet map contains more adjacent lanelets than [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) indicates, the package tries to remove wrongly mapped lanelets:
  - as long as there are more adjacent lanelets in the lanelet map than [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) indicates, lanelets are removed if they neither have a predecessor nor a successor
  - more steps can be implemented, however, keep in mind that you are absolutely sure if you want to delete something as the information from [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org/) might be wrong as well
- image below exemplarily shows the deletion of an existing lanelet fragment\
